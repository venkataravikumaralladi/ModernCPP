In order to set a quantified safety integrity target, a target `Maximum Tolerable Risk` is needed. In any event, the final choice of Maximum Tolerable Risk (in any scenario) forms part of the `safety argument` put forward by a system user. `Hazard` means potential to cause harm. `Risk` is the likelihood of harm in defined circumstances.

Actual degree of risk considered to be tolerable will vary according to a number of factors such as degree of control one has over the circumstances, the voluntary or involuntary nature of the risk, the number of persons at risk any incident, the level of exposoure of hazard and so on.

To evaluate a risk we have to consider many factors into consideration for hazard like `how` hazard is exposed?, `where` hazard is exposed?, how `much` hazard is exposed? and how `long` hazard is exposed?
                                    
We can define the risk as ` R = C * P (accident | hazard) * P(hazard)`. From this expression, we see that we can reduce the risk in two ways: by focusing
on the hazard—prevention, or by preventing the hazard from causing an accident—control. `C` is accident severity.
