In order to set a quantified safety integrity target, a target `Maximum Tolerable Risk` is needed. In any event, the final choice of Maximum Tolerable Risk (in any scenario) forms part of the `safety argument` put forward by a system user. `Hazard` means potential to cause harm. `Risk` is the likelihood of harm in defined circumstances.

Actual degree of risk considered to be tolerable will vary according to a number of factors such as degree of control one has over the circumstances, the voluntary or involuntary nature of the risk, the number of persons at risk any incident, the level of exposoure of hazard and so on.

To evaluate a risk we have to consider many factors into consideration for hazard like `how` hazard is exposed?, `where` hazard is exposed?, how `much` hazard is exposed? and how `long` hazard is exposed?
                                    
We can define the risk as ` R = C * P (accident | hazard) * P(hazard)`. From this expression, we see that we can reduce the risk in two ways: by focusing
on the hazard—prevention, or by preventing the hazard from causing an accident—control. `C` is accident severity.

<h3> ALARP </h3>

ALARP (As Low As Reasonable Practical) is one of the risk acceptance technique—we have done all that is reasonable to prevent dangerous events. A reasonable goal is to reduce risk until the extra mitigation cost exceeds the risk reduction value achieved. This leads to a strategy where we assess all risks, rank them, and mitigate as many of the risk causes as economically reasonable. 

The term `Reasonably Practicable` has a legal definition, at least in the UK defined as below. <br />

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; * “Reasonably practicable” is a narrower term than “physically possible.” <br>
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; * A computation must be made by the owner, in which the quantum of risk is placed on one scale and the sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting the risk is placed in the other. <br>
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; * If there is a gross disproportion between them—the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice—the defendants discharge the onus on them. <br>
 &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;* This computation shall be made by the owner at a point of time anterior to the accident. <br>
      
The term “Gross disproportion,” used in issue 3 in the definition above, has an agreed-upon definition, as follows: If a measure is practicable and it cannot be shown that the cost of the measure is grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained, then the measure is considered reasonably practicable and should be implemented. Thus, the criterion is reasonably practicable, not reasonably affordable: justifiable cost and effort are not determined by the budget constraints/viability of a project.

Once the area of tolerability is decided, Following Fig.  shows how we shall handle the risks—IEC 61508-5:2010.
