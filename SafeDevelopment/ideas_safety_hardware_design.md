### General safety hardware design

 Generally high-performance functional safety controller have two microcontrollers, the main chip  and companion chip.  This controller
 has two microcontrollers, one for standard function and the other for real time diagnostic via the cross communication, it includes various 
 functionalities like digital input, digital output, analogue input and pulse width modulation output. The companion chip micro-controller 
 is to switch off the whole system in case of a detected failure.
